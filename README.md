# Satellite Image Analysis

## 🌟 Overview
This project focuses on processing and analyzing satellite imagery to extract meaningful insights. It uses clustering techniques like K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means for image segmentation and advanced visualization methods to represent the data. The goal is to demonstrate how machine learning and image processing can be applied to satellite data for various applications, such as land cover classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring.
